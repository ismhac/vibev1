# Story 1.4: Implement Shared Footer Component

*   **Parent Epic:** [Epic 1: Project Foundation & Core Layout](../epics/epic-1.md)
*   **Status:** Done

## 1. Goal/User Story

As a User, I want to see a consistent footer at the bottom of every page, so that I can find key company information and statistics.

## 2. Requirements

*   Create a reusable Footer component within the `shared` module.
*   The Footer must have three columns: "Contact us", "About us", "Statistics".
*   The "Statistics" column must include a placeholder for the real-time counter.
*   **The component must be implemented following the `frontend-architecture.md` (Section 5: Component Strategy) and adhere to the naming conventions (Section 3.2).**
*   The Footer component should be placed in the main `app.component.html`.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   **AC1:** A `FooterComponent` is created in the `src/app/shared/components/` directory as per the project structure. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Component created in `src/app/shared/components/footer/` with all required files.
*   **AC2:** When the application runs, the Footer is always visible and fixed at the bottom of the viewport. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Footer styled with `position: fixed` at bottom with proper z-index.
*   **AC3:** The Footer correctly displays the three columns with their respective titles and placeholder content. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Contact us, About us, and Statistics columns implemented with content.
*   **AC4:** The "Statistics" column contains a visible counter (initially can be a static number, e.g., "0"). ✅ **COMPLETED** - Counter initialized to 1234 with simulated real-time updates.

## 4. Implementation Summary

**Created FooterComponent following architecture guidelines:**
- ✅ Component structure: `src/app/shared/components/footer/`
- ✅ Follows naming conventions: `kebab-case` files, `PascalCase` class name
- ✅ Implements OnInit/OnDestroy lifecycle hooks for counter management
- ✅ Uses NG-ZORRO components (`nz-layout`, `nz-footer`)

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **footer.ts**: Component class with counter simulation and lifecycle management
- **footer.html**: Three-column layout with Contact, About, and Statistics sections
- **footer.scss**: FPT Software branding with orange gradient background
- **footer.spec.ts**: Comprehensive unit tests covering all functionality

**Three-Column Content:**
1. **Contact us**: FPT Software address, phone, and email
2. **About us**: Company description and specialization areas
3. **Statistics**: Real-time visitor counter + company stats (25+ years, 40+ countries)

**Styling & UX:**
- Fixed positioning at bottom of viewport (z-index: 999)
- FPT Software brand gradient: #ff7700 to #ff9933 orange
- White text with proper contrast and readability
- Responsive grid layout (3 columns → 2 columns → 1 column)
- Hover animations on statistics cards

**Counter Implementation:**
- Initial value: 1234 visitors
- Simulated real-time updates every 5 seconds
- Random increment 1-3 to simulate realistic visitor flow
- Proper cleanup on component destroy

**Integration:**
- Added to `app.component.html` for global visibility
- Main content area adjusted with bottom margin (280px)
- Footer bottom section with copyright and current year
