# Story 4.4: Implement API Authorization Mechanism (Guards)

*   **Parent Epic:** [Epic 4: Admin Portal & Content Management](../epics/epic-4.md)
*   **Status:** Review

## 1. Goal/User Story

As a Developer, I want to create protection mechanisms so that only valid users can access protected APIs.

## 2. Requirements

*   Create a `JwtAuthGuard` to validate the JWT in the request header.
*   Create a `RolesGuard` to check the user's role (`Admin`, `Editor`).

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   **AC1:** An API protected by `JwtAuthGuard` returns a 401 error if the token is missing or invalid.
*   **AC2:** An API protected by `RolesGuard('Admin')` returns a 403 (Forbidden) error if the user has a role other than "Admin".

## 4. Implementation Summary

### **Authorization Guards Implementation:**
- **JwtAuthGuard**: Created JWT authentication guard for token validation
- **RolesGuard**: Created role-based authorization guard for access control
- **Decorators**: Created @Public and @Roles decorators for route protection
- **Test Controller**: Created comprehensive test endpoints for guard validation

### **Key Features Implemented:**
1. **JwtAuthGuard**: Validates JWT tokens and protects routes
2. **RolesGuard**: Enforces role-based access control
3. **@Public Decorator**: Marks routes as public (no authentication required)
4. **@Roles Decorator**: Specifies required roles for route access
5. **Test Endpoints**: Comprehensive test suite for guard validation
6. **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages

### **Technical Implementation:**
- **JwtAuthGuard**: Extends AuthGuard('jwt') with public route support
- **RolesGuard**: Implements CanActivate interface for role checking
- **Decorators**: Use SetMetadata for route metadata
- **Test Controller**: Multiple endpoints for different access levels
- **Error Responses**: Proper 401 Unauthorized and 403 Forbidden responses

### **Security Features:**
- **Token Validation**: JWT token validation with proper error handling
- **Role-based Access**: Granular access control based on user roles
- **Public Routes**: Support for public endpoints without authentication
- **Error Security**: Secure error messages without exposing sensitive information
- **Guard Composition**: Multiple guards can be combined for complex protection

### **Code Quality:**
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with proper interfaces
- **NestJS Best Practices**: Proper guard implementation and decorator usage
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Security**: Secure authorization mechanisms
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test endpoints for validation
