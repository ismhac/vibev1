# Story 3.5 (Frontend): Implement Subscription Form

*   **Parent Epic:** [Epic 3: Homepage & User Engagement](../epics/epic-3.md)
*   **Status:** Review

## 1. Goal/User Story

As a User, I want to be able to subscribe to news from the homepage to stay in touch with the company.

## 2. Requirements

*   In the `HomePageComponent`, create a form with two fields: `Full Name` and `Email`.
*   Implement basic validation: both fields are required, and the email must be in a valid format.
*   On form submission, call the `POST /api/v1/subscriptions` API with the entered data.
*   Display a success or failure message to the user.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   **AC1:** The form cannot be submitted if the data is invalid.
*   **AC2:** After a successful submission, the data is sent to the backend, and the user receives a success message.
