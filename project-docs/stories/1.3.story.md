# Story 1.3: Implement Shared Navbar Component

*   **Parent Epic:** [Epic 1: Project Foundation & Core Layout](../epics/epic-1.md)
*   **Status:** Done

## 1. Goal/User Story

As a User, I want to see a consistent navigation bar at the top of every page, so that I can easily navigate the website.

## 2. Requirements

*   Create a reusable Navbar component within the `shared` module.
*   The Navbar must contain the FPT Software logo.
*   The Navbar must display the following navigation links: Home, About, Industries, Announcements, Contact.
*   **The component must be implemented following the `frontend-architecture.md` (Section 5: Component Strategy) and adhere to the naming conventions (Section 3.2).**
*   The Navbar component should be placed in the main `app.component.html` to be displayed on all pages.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   **AC1:** A `NavbarComponent` is created in the `src/app/shared/components/` directory as per the project structure. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Component created in `src/app/shared/components/navbar/` with all required files.
*   **AC2:** When the application runs, the Navbar is always visible and fixed at the top of the viewport. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Navbar styled with `position: fixed` and proper z-index.
*   **AC3:** The Navbar correctly displays the logo and all specified menu links. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - FPT Software logo icon and all 5 navigation links implemented.
*   **AC4:** The menu item for the currently active page is visually highlighted. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - `isRouteActive()` method implemented with visual highlighting.

## 4. Implementation Summary

**Created NavbarComponent following architecture guidelines:**
- ‚úÖ Component structure: `src/app/shared/components/navbar/`
- ‚úÖ Follows naming conventions: `kebab-case` files, `PascalCase` class name

- ‚úÖ Uses NG-ZORRO components (`nz-layout`, `nz-header`, `nz-menu`)

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **navbar.ts**: Component class with Router injection and `isRouteActive()` method
- **navbar.html**: NG-ZORRO template with logo and navigation menu

- Responsive design for mobile devices

**Styling & UX:**
- Fixed positioning at top of viewport (z-index: 1000)
- FPT Software brand colors: white background, #ff7700 orange highlights
- Smooth hover transitions and active state styling
- Main content area offset by navbar height (64px)

**Integration:**
- Added to `app.component.html` for global visibility
- Imported into `App` component with proper dependencies
- RouterModule integration for navigation functionality
