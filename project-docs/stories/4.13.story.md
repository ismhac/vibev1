# Story 4.13: Implement Logout Functionality

*   **Parent Epic:** [Epic 4: Admin Portal & Content Management](../epics/epic-4.md)
*   **Status:** Review

## 1. Goal/User Story

As a logged-in user, I want to be able to log out of the admin portal to secure my account.

## 2. Requirements

*   Add a "Logout" button to the general admin layout.
*   When clicked, the JWT must be removed from `localStorage`.
*   The user must be redirected to the login page.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   **AC1:** Clicking "Logout" removes the token.
*   **AC2:** After logging out, the user is redirected to the login page.

## 4. Implementation Summary

### Technical Implementation Details:
- **Logout Button**: Already implemented in `AdminLayoutComponent` template with proper click handler
- **AuthService Integration**: `logout()` method properly calls `AuthService.logout()`
- **Token Management**: `AuthService.logout()` removes JWT token from localStorage
- **User Data Cleanup**: User data is removed from localStorage after logout
- **State Management**: BehaviorSubject states are updated to reflect logout
- **Navigation**: Automatic redirect to login page after logout

### Key Features Delivered:
- **Logout Button**: Present in both sidebar and header areas of admin layout
- **Token Removal**: JWT token is completely removed from localStorage
- **User Data Cleanup**: All user-related data is cleared from localStorage
- **State Updates**: Authentication state is properly updated
- **Navigation**: User is redirected to login page after logout
- **Multiple Logout Calls**: Handles multiple logout calls gracefully

### Code Structure:
- **AdminLayoutComponent**: Contains logout button and calls AuthService
- **AuthService**: Handles all logout logic including token removal and navigation
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for logout functionality
