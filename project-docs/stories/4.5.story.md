# Story 4.5: Implement User Management API (Admin only)

*   **Parent Epic:** [Epic 4: Admin Portal & Content Management](../epics/epic-4.md)
*   **Status:** Review

## 1. Goal/User Story

As an Admin, I want to have APIs to manage other user accounts.

## 2. Requirements

*   Build CRUD endpoints (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) for the `/api/v1/users` resource.
*   All these endpoints must be protected by both `JwtAuthGuard` and `RolesGuard('Admin')`.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   **AC1:** Only users with the "Admin" role can successfully access these endpoints.
*   **AC2:** The functions for creating, listing, viewing, updating, and deleting users work correctly.

## 4. Implementation Summary

### **User Management API Implementation:**
- **CRUD Endpoints**: Created complete CRUD operations for user management
- **Admin Protection**: All endpoints protected by JwtAuthGuard and RolesGuard('Admin')
- **User Service**: Comprehensive business logic for user operations
- **DTOs**: Complete data transfer objects for request/response validation

### **Key Features Implemented:**
1. **Create User**: POST /api/v1/users with user creation data
2. **List Users**: GET /api/v1/users with pagination support
3. **Get User**: GET /api/v1/users/:id for specific user details
4. **Update User**: PATCH /api/v1/users/:id for user updates
5. **Delete User**: DELETE /api/v1/users/:id for user removal
6. **Admin Protection**: All endpoints require Admin role access

### **Technical Implementation:**
- **UsersController**: RESTful controller with CRUD endpoints
- **UsersService**: Business logic for user operations with database integration
- **User DTOs**: CreateUserDto, UpdateUserDto, UserResponseDto, UserListResponseDto
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing for secure password storage
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation with class-validator
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error responses

### **Security Features:**
- **Admin-only Access**: All endpoints protected by JwtAuthGuard and RolesGuard('Admin')
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing for secure password storage
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all user data
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without exposing sensitive information
- **Role-based Access**: Only Admin users can access user management endpoints

### **Code Quality:**
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with proper interfaces and DTOs
- **NestJS Best Practices**: Proper dependency injection and module structure
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Security**: Secure password handling and user management
- **Validation**: Input validation with class-validator decorators
