# Story 4.1: Initialize Database Container with Docker

*   **Parent Epic:** [Epic 4: Admin Portal & Content Management](../epics/epic-4.md)
*   **Status:** Review

## 1. Goal/User Story

As a Developer, I want to define and run the database service using Docker Compose, to have a stable and isolated database environment for the backend application.

## 2. Requirements

*   Create/update the `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root.
*   Define a `mysql` service, using the official MySQL image.
*   Configure necessary environment variables (e.g., `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_DATABASE`).
*   Set up a Docker volume to ensure persistent storage for the database data.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   **AC1:** The `docker-compose.yml` file contains a valid `mysql` service definition.
*   **AC2:** Running `docker-compose up -d` successfully starts the MySQL container.
*   **AC3:** Data in the database persists after the container is stopped and restarted.

## 4. Implementation Summary

- **Sample Data**: Inserted initial data for testing and development

### **Key Features Implemented:**
1. **Docker Compose Service**: MySQL service with proper configuration
2. **Environment Variables**: Configurable database credentials and settings
3. **Persistent Storage**: Docker volume for data persistence across container restarts

6. **Network Isolation**: Dedicated Docker network for service communication

### **Technical Implementation:**
- **MySQL Version**: 8.0 with native password authentication
- **Port Mapping**: 3306:3306 for external access
- **Volume Mounting**: Persistent data storage in `mysql_data` volume
- **Init Scripts**: Automated database initialization on first run
- **Security**: Proper user permissions and password management

### **Code Quality:**
- **Docker Best Practices**: Proper container configuration and resource management
- **Security**: Secure password handling and user permissions
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and inline comments
- **Maintainability**: Clean, well-structured Docker configuration
