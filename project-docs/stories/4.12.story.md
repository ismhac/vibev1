## 6. Notes

### Implementation Decisions
- **Rich Text Editor**: Chose Quill over other editors for its simplicity and Angular compatibility
- **File Upload**: Implemented client-side file validation and preview for better UX
- **Tag System**: Created dynamic tag management for flexible content categorization

- **Export Functionality**: Could add export to PDF/Word functionality
- **Content Templates**: Could add predefined content templates for common announcement types

### Technical Debt
- None identified for this story

### Dependencies
