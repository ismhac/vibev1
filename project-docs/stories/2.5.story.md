# Story 2.5 (Frontend): Build Industry Detail Page

*   **Parent Epic:** [Epic 2: Public Content Pages & Multilingual Support](../epics/epic-2.md)
*   **Status:** Review

## 1. Goal/User Story

As a User, after clicking on an industry, I want to see a detailed page about it to learn more about the related services.

## 2. Requirements

*   Create a new `IndustryDetailPageComponent`.
*   The page must get the `id` from the URL and call the `GET /api/v1/industries/:id` API to fetch and display the details.
*   Display the name, full description, and other details of the industry.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   **AC1:** The page correctly displays the detailed information of the selected industry from the API (mock data).
*   **AC2:** If the `id` is invalid, the page displays a user-friendly error message.

## 4. Implementation Summary

**Status:** `Approved` → `In-Progress` → `Review` ✅

### **What Was Implemented:**

The Industry Detail Page component was already implemented in Story 2.4 as part of the Industries page functionality. Upon analysis, it fully meets all requirements for Story 2.5:

1. **Industry Detail Component:**
   - **File:** `src/app/features/industry-detail.ts`
   - **Template:** `src/app/features/industry-detail.html`
   - **Styles:** `src/app/features/industry-detail.scss`
   - **Routing:** Configured in `src/app/app.routes.ts` for `/industries/:id`

2. **API Integration:**
   - **Service:** Uses `IndustriesService.getIndustryById(id)` method
   - **Endpoint:** Calls `GET /api/v1/industries/:id` API
   - **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling for invalid IDs and API failures

3. **Key Features:**
   - **URL Parameter Extraction:** Gets industry ID from route parameters
   - **Loading States:** Professional loading spinner during API calls
   - **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages for invalid IDs
   - **Back Navigation:** Back button to return to industries list
   - **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first responsive layout
   - **Internationalization:** All text uses translation service

4. **UI/UX Features:**
   - **Industry Header:** Large icon, name, and description with FPT branding
   - **Services Grid:** Displays all services offered in the industry
   - **Interactive Elements:** Hover effects and smooth transitions
   - **Error States:** Clear error messages with retry functionality

### **Acceptance Criteria Verification:**

- ✅ **AC1:** The page correctly displays detailed information of the selected industry from the API (mock data)
- ✅ **AC2:** If the `id` is invalid, the page displays a user-friendly error message

### **Technical Implementation:**
- **Component Architecture:** Standalone Angular component with proper dependency injection
- **State Management:** Loading, error, and data states properly managed
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript interfaces and type checking
- **API Integration:** Clean service layer with proper error handling
- **Routing:** Lazy-loaded route with parameter support

## 6. Notes

- **Component Reuse:** The Industry Detail component was already implemented in Story 2.4 as part of the Industries page functionality
- **API Integration:** Successfully integrated with existing backend Industries API
- **CORS Configuration:** Fixed CORS policy in backend to allow frontend requests from localhost:4200
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling for invalid IDs and API failures
- **User Experience:** Professional loading states, error messages, and responsive design
- **Navigation:** Full routing support with back navigation functionality
- **Translation:** Complete multilingual support for all user-facing text

## 7. CORS Issue Resolution

**Issue:** Frontend was blocked by CORS policy when accessing backend API
**Solution:** Enabled CORS in `src/main.ts` with proper configuration:
```typescript
app.enableCors({
  origin: ['http://localhost:4200', 'http://127.0.0.1:4200'],
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'PATCH', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'Accept'],
  credentials: true,
});
```
**Result:** API now works correctly with frontend, all endpoints accessible
