## 1. Goal/User Story

As a User, I want to see a page that lists the latest news and announcements from the company.

## 2. Requirements

*   Create a new `AnnouncementsPageComponent`.

*   Display each announcement with its title, publication date, and a summary.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   **AC1:** The page successfully displays the list of announcements from the API (mock data).
*   **AC2:** The layout must be responsive and include pagination support.
