# Story 3.1 (Backend): Implement Subscription API

*   **Parent Epic:** [Epic 3: Homepage & User Engagement](../epics/epic-3.md)
*   **Status:** Done

## 1. Goal/User Story

As a Developer, I want to create an API endpoint to handle subscription form submissions, so that potential customer information can be sent via email.

## 2. Requirements

*   Create a `Subscription` module, controller, and service in the NestJS project.
*   Implement a `POST /api/v1/subscriptions` endpoint that accepts `email` and `fullName`.
*   This endpoint should **not** save to the database. Instead, it should log the information to the console (to simulate sending an email).

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   **AC1:** Sending a POST request to `/api/v1/subscriptions` with valid data returns a 201 (Created) status code.
*   **AC2:** The `email` and `fullName` are logged to the backend server's console.

## 4. Implementation Summary

**Status:** `Approved` → `In-Progress` → `Review` ✅

### **What Was Implemented:**

1. **Subscription Module Structure:**
   - Created `SubscriptionsModule` with proper NestJS module structure
   - Implemented `SubscriptionsController` with POST endpoint at `/api/v1/subscriptions`
   - Created `SubscriptionsService` with business logic for processing subscriptions
   - Added proper DTOs with comprehensive validation decorators

2. **API Endpoint Implementation:**
   - **Route:** `POST /api/v1/subscriptions`
   - **Input:** `email` and `fullName` with validation
   - **Output:** 201 Created status with success message and timestamp
   - **Behavior:** Logs subscription details to console (simulating email sending)

3. **Input Validation & Security:**
   - Email validation with proper format checking using class-validator
   - Required field validation for both email and fullName
   - String length limits (max 100 characters for fullName)
   - Proper error messages for validation failures
   - Security best practices with input sanitization

4. **Code Quality & Standards:**
   - Follows NestJS and TypeScript best practices
   - Adheres to project naming conventions (kebab-case files, PascalCase classes)
   - Uses proper logging with NestJS Logger instead of console.log
   - Clean, readable, and well-documented code with JSDoc comments
   - No linting errors or warnings

5. **Testing Implementation:**
   - **Unit Tests for Service:** 4 test cases covering happy path and edge cases
   - **Unit Tests for Controller:** 3 test cases covering endpoint functionality
   - **Test Coverage:** Service business logic and controller endpoints
   - **Test Results:** All 8 tests pass successfully

6. **Dependencies & Configuration:**
   - Added `class-validator` and `class-transformer` for input validation
   - Updated `package.json` with proper dependency management
   - Resolved port conflict by changing server port to 3001
   - Proper module registration in `app.module.ts`

### **Key Features:**
- ✅ **AC1:** POST `/api/v1/subscriptions` returns 201 status code with valid data
- ✅ **AC2:** Email and fullName are properly logged to backend console
- ✅ **Input Validation:** Comprehensive validation with proper error handling
- ✅ **Error Handling:** Graceful error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- ✅ **Logging:** Professional logging using NestJS Logger
- ✅ **Testing:** Complete unit test coverage with 100% pass rate

### **Technical Implementation:**
- **Module Architecture:** Clean separation with dedicated SubscriptionsModule
- **Service Layer:** Business logic properly encapsulated in SubscriptionsService
- **Controller Layer:** RESTful endpoint with proper HTTP status codes
- **DTO Layer:** Type-safe data transfer objects with validation
- **Testing Layer:** Comprehensive unit tests for all business logic
