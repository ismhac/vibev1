# Story 1.1: Technical Setup - Initialize Frontend Project

*   **Parent Epic:** [Epic 1: Project Foundation & Core Layout](../epics/epic-1.md)
*   **Status:** Done

## 1. Goal/User Story

As a Developer, I want to initialize a new Angular project with all core libraries and configurations set up, so that I have a standardized and ready-to-use foundation for frontend development.

## 2. Requirements

*   Create a new Angular application using the Angular CLI.
*   Integrate the `NG-ZORRO` UI library.
*   Set up `NgRx` for state management.
*   Configure `ESLint` and `Prettier` for code quality and consistent formatting.
*   **The folder structure must strictly adhere to the guidelines in `frontend-architecture.md` (Section 3: Project Structure).**

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   **AC1:** A new Angular project is created and can be run locally using the `ng serve` command. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Project builds successfully with `ng build`, tests pass with `npm test`.
*   **AC2:** `NG-ZORRO`, `NgRx`, `ESLint`, and `Prettier` are installed and their basic configuration files are present in the project. ✅ **COMPLETED** - All libraries installed and configured, linting passes clean.
*   **AC3:** The folder structure inside `src/app/` matches the design in the `frontend-architecture.md` document (e.g., `core`, `shared`, `features` folders are created). ✅ **COMPLETED** - Full folder structure created as specified.

## 4. Implementation Summary

**Created Angular project structure:**
- ✅ New Angular project: `fpt-software-website`
- ✅ Integrated NG-ZORRO UI library with auto-configuration
- ✅ Set up NgRx store with effects and devtools
- ✅ Configured ESLint with Angular rules and Prettier integration
- ✅ Created complete folder structure per frontend-architecture.md:
  - `src/app/core/` - Core services, guards, interceptors
  - `src/app/shared/components/` - Shared reusable components  
  - `src/app/features/` - Feature modules (auth, home, about, industries, announcements, contact, admin)

**Key Configuration Files Created:**
- `.prettierrc` - Code formatting configuration
- `.prettierignore` - Files excluded from formatting
- `eslint.config.js` - Linting rules with Prettier integration
- Updated `package.json` with format scripts and prettier config

**Verification Results:**
- Project builds successfully: ✅ `ng build` completes without errors
- Linting passes: ✅ `npm run lint` shows "All files pass linting"
- Tests pass: ✅ `npm test` shows "2 SUCCESS" 
- Formatting works: ✅ `npm run format` fixes code style issues
