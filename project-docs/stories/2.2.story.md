# Story 2.2 (Backend): Implement Announcements API

*   **Parent Epic:** [Epic 2: Public Content Pages & Multilingual Support](../epics/epic-2.md)
*   **Status:** Done

## 1. Goal/User Story

As a Developer, I want to build the API endpoints for "Announcements" to provide news data to the frontend.

## 2. Requirements

*   Create an `Announcement` module, controller, service, and entity in the NestJS project.
*   Implement `GET /api/v1/announcements` to fetch a list of announcements (with pagination support).
*   **Important:** This API must return fixed, mocked data.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   **AC1:** The `GET /api/v1/announcements` endpoint returns a list of mock announcement objects with the defined structure. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Endpoint returns paginated list with 8 mock announcements.

## 4. Implementation Summary

**Created complete Announcements API with mock data:**
- ✅ **Announcement Entity:** `src/announcements/entities/announcement.entity.ts` with comprehensive structure
- ✅ **Announcement DTOs:** `src/announcements/dto/announcement.dto.ts` for request/response validation
- ✅ **Announcement Service:** `src/announcements/announcements.service.ts` with 8 mock announcements and pagination
- ✅ **Announcement Controller:** `src/announcements/announcements.controller.ts` with GET endpoint
- ✅ **Announcement Module:** `src/announcements/announcements.module.ts` integrated with AppModule

**API Endpoint Implemented:**
- **GET /api/v1/announcements** - Returns paginated list of published announcements
  - Query parameters: `page` (default: 1), `limit` (default: 10)
  - Response: `{ data: Announcement[], total: number, page: number, limit: number }`
  - Only returns published announcements (`isPublished: true`)

**Mock Data Structure:**
- 8 comprehensive announcement objects with realistic FPT Software news
- Each announcement includes: id, title, content, summary, author, category, priority, isPublished, publishedAt, createdAt, updatedAt, tags, imageUrl, readTime
- Categories: Company News, Awards & Recognition, Partnerships, Product Launch, Company Milestone, Events, Sustainability, Service Updates
- Priorities: high, medium, low
- All announcements are published and ready for frontend consumption

**Key Features:**
- Pagination support for efficient data loading
- Only published announcements are returned
- Rich content structure with summaries, tags, and metadata
- Professional FPT Software news content
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout

**Testing:**
- Comprehensive e2e tests covering all scenarios
- Pagination testing with different page/limit parameters
- Data structure validation
- Published-only filtering verification
- All 5 tests passing successfully

**Architecture Compliance:**
- Follows NestJS best practices with proper module structure
- Clean separation of concerns (Entity, DTO, Service, Controller)
- TypeScript strict typing throughout
- Proper dependency injection and service patterns
