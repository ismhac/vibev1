# Story 1.5: Establish Basic Page Routing Structure

*   **Parent Epic:** [Epic 1: Project Foundation & Core Layout](../epics/epic-1.md)
*   **Status:** Done

## 1. Goal/User Story

As a Developer, I want to set up the basic routing system for the application, so that the navigation links work and there are placeholder pages for future development.

## 2. Requirements

*   Create a main routing module (`app-routing.module.ts`).
*   Define routes for `Home`, `About`, `Industries`, `Announcements`, and `Contact`.
*   Each route should point to a simple placeholder component (e.g., `HomeComponent`, `AboutComponent`).
*   These placeholder components should be created within a new `pages` module.
*   The navigation links in the `NavbarComponent` must be updated to use the `routerLink` directive.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   **AC1:** The main routing module is created and imported into the root `AppModule`. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Routes configured in `app.routes.ts` with standalone component architecture.
*   **AC2:** Placeholder components for all main pages are created. ✅ **COMPLETED** - All 5 page components created in `src/app/features/`.
*   **AC3:** Clicking on the links in the Navbar correctly navigates the user to the corresponding placeholder page without a full page reload. ✅ **COMPLETED** - RouterLink directives working with lazy-loaded components.
*   **AC4:** The content of the placeholder page (e.g., "Home Page Works!") is displayed correctly. ✅ **COMPLETED** - All pages display meaningful content with FPT Software branding.

## 4. Implementation Summary

**Created complete routing system with placeholder pages:**
- ✅ Routes configuration in `app.routes.ts` using standalone components
- ✅ Five page components created: Home, About, Industries, Announcements, Contact
- ✅ Lazy loading implemented for optimal performance
- ✅ Navigation integration with existing navbar component

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **app.routes.ts**: Route definitions with lazy loading and wildcard handling
- **Page Components**: 
  - `src/app/features/home.ts` - Welcome to FPT Software
  - `src/app/features/about.ts` - About FPT Software  
  - `src/app/features/industries.ts` - Industries We Serve
  - `src/app/features/announcements.ts` - Latest Announcements
  - `src/app/features/contact.ts` - Contact Us

**Routing Features:**
- Default redirect from root to `/home`
- Lazy-loaded components for performance optimization
- Wildcard route for 404 handling (redirects to home)
- Integration with existing navbar `routerLink` directives

**Styling & UX:**
- Consistent page layout with `.page-container` styling
- FPT Software branding colors (#ff7700 orange)
- Responsive design with proper spacing
- Professional typography and content structure

**Navigation Integration:**
- Existing navbar `routerLink` directives already configured
- Active route highlighting working correctly
- Single Page Application (SPA) behavior - no page reloads

**Architecture Compliance:**
- Follows frontend-architecture.md structure (components in features/)
- Standalone component architecture (Angular 17+ style)
- Proper separation of concerns (template, styles, logic)
- Lazy loading for performance optimization
