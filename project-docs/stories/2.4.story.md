# Story 2.4 (Frontend): Build Industries Page

*   **Parent Epic:** [Epic 2: Public Content Pages & Multilingual Support](../epics/epic-2.md)
*   **Status:** Done

## 1. Goal/User Story

As a User, I want to see a page listing all the industries the company serves, so I can understand the company's expertise.

## 2. Requirements

*   Create a new `IndustriesPageComponent`.
*   The page must call the `GET /api/v1/industries` API to fetch and display the list of industries.
*   Display the data as a grid of cards, with each card showing the name and a short description of an industry.
*   Each card must be clickable to navigate to the detail page.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   **AC1:** The page successfully displays the list of industries from the API (mock data).
*   **AC2:** The layout must be responsive.
*   **AC3:** Clicking on an industry card navigates the user to the `/industries/:id` route.

## 4. Implementation Summary

**Status:** `Approved` → `In-Progress` → `Review` ✅

### **What Was Implemented:**

1. **Industries Service:**
   - Created `IndustriesService` in `src/app/core/services/industries.service.ts`
   - Implemented API calls to `GET /api/v1/industries` and `GET /api/v1/industries/:id`
   - Added proper TypeScript interfaces for Industry and IndustryListResponse
   - Integrated with existing backend API endpoints

2. **Industries Page Component:**
   - Updated `industries.ts` with full API integration
   - Added loading states, error handling, and retry functionality
   - Implemented responsive grid layout using NG-ZORRO components
   - Added translation support for all UI text

3. **Industry Detail Page:**
   - Created `industry-detail.ts` component for individual industry pages
   - Added routing support for `/industries/:id` paths
   - Implemented back navigation and error handling
   - Added comprehensive styling and responsive design

4. **UI/UX Features:**
   - **Responsive Grid Layout:** Cards adapt to different screen sizes (xs: 1, sm: 2, md: 3, lg: 3, xl: 4)
   - **Interactive Cards:** Hover effects, clickable navigation, and visual feedback
   - **Loading States:** Spinner and loading messages during API calls
   - **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages with retry functionality
   - **Empty States:** Proper handling when no data is available

5. **Styling & Design:**
   - **FPT Branding:** Orange gradient headers and consistent color scheme
   - **Card Design:** Modern cards with icons, descriptions, and service previews

6. **Internationalization:**
   - Added comprehensive translations for English and Vietnamese
   - All user-facing text uses translation service
   - Consistent with existing translation architecture

### **Key Features:**
- ✅ **AC1:** Successfully displays industries from API (mock data from backend)
- ✅ **AC2:** Fully responsive layout that works on all screen sizes
- ✅ **AC3:** Clicking industry cards navigates to `/industries/:id` route
- ✅ **API Integration:** Real-time data fetching from backend
- ✅ **Error Handling:** Graceful error states with retry functionality
- ✅ **Loading States:** Professional loading indicators
- ✅ **Translation Support:** Full multilingual support

### **Technical Implementation:**
- **Service Layer:** Clean separation with dedicated IndustriesService
- **Component Architecture:** Standalone components with proper dependency injection
