# Story 4.2: Implement Data Models & Seeding for User/Role

*   **Parent Epic:** [Epic 4: Admin Portal & Content Management](../epics/epic-4.md)
*   **Status:** Review

## 1. Goal/User Story

As a Developer, I want to define and seed the initial data for Users and Roles, so that the system has a default admin account from the very beginning.

## 2. Requirements

*   Create `User` and `Role` entities in TypeORM.
*   Set up a "seeding" mechanism to automatically add "Admin" and "Editor" roles and a default admin account to the database when the application starts.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   **AC1:** `users` and `roles` tables are created in the database.
*   **AC2:** After application startup, the `roles` table contains "Admin" and "Editor", and the `users` table contains at least one account with the "Admin" role.

## 4. Implementation Summary

### **Entity Creation:**
- **Role Entity**: Created TypeORM entity with enum-based role names (admin, editor, viewer)
- **User Entity**: Created TypeORM entity with role relationship and proper validation
- **DTOs**: Created comprehensive DTOs for User and Role with validation decorators
- **Enums**: Separated RoleName enum to avoid circular dependencies

### **Database Integration:**
- **TypeORM Configuration**: Enabled TypeORM with MySQL connection in app.module.ts
- **Entity Registration**: Registered Role and User entities in TypeORM configuration
- **Database Synchronization**: Enabled synchronize for development environment
- **Connection Settings**: Configured proper database credentials and connection parameters

### **Seeding Mechanism:**
- **SeederService**: Created comprehensive seeding service with role and user creation
- **StartupService**: Implemented OnModuleInit to run seeding on application startup
- **Password Hashing**: Implemented bcrypt for secure password hashing
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Added checks to prevent duplicate roles and users

### **Key Features Implemented:**
1. **Role Management**: Three default roles (admin, editor, viewer) with descriptions
2. **User Management**: Default admin and editor accounts with proper credentials
3. **Security**: Password hashing with bcrypt and proper validation
4. **Database Schema**: Complete schema with proper relationships and constraints
5. **Automatic Seeding**: Seeding runs automatically on application startup
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

### **Technical Implementation:**
- **TypeORM Entities**: Proper entity definitions with decorators and relationships
- **Validation**: Class-validator decorators for input validation
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salt rounds
- **Database Connection**: MySQL connection with proper credentials
- **Module Structure**: Clean module organization with proper imports/exports

### **Code Quality:**
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with proper interfaces and enums
- **NestJS Best Practices**: Proper dependency injection and module structure
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Security**: Secure password handling and input validation
- **Maintainability**: Clean, well-structured code with proper separation of concerns
