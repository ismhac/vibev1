## 1. Goal/User Story

As a User, I want to see a section showcasing featured industries on the homepage to get a quick overview of the company's capabilities.

## 2. Requirements

*   In the `HomePageComponent`, call the `GET /api/v1/industries` API to fetch data.
*   Display a **maximum of 4** industries from the API result.
*   Each industry should be displayed as a clickable card.
*   Include a "View All" button that navigates the user to the `/industries` page.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   **AC1:** The section correctly displays 4 industries from the API (mock data).
*   **AC2:** Clicking an industry navigates to its detail page.
*   **AC3:** Clicking the "View All" button navigates to the `/industries` page.
