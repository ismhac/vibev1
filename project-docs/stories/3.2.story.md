# Story 3.2 (Frontend): Build Homepage Layout

*   **Parent Epic:** [Epic 3: Homepage & User Engagement](../epics/epic-3.md)
*   **Status:** Review

## 1. Goal/User Story

As a Developer, I want to create the main layout structure for the homepage, including placeholders for the different content sections.

## 2. Requirements

*   Create a new `HomePageComponent`.
*   Build the HTML structure for the homepage, divided into the main sections: Hero Banner, Industries, Announcements, and Subscription Form.
*   Each section should initially be a `div` with a clear class name as a placeholder.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   **AC1:** The `HomePageComponent` is created and displayed when navigating to the root route (`/`).
*   **AC2:** The page's HTML structure contains placeholder `divs` for the 4 specified sections.

## 4. Implementation Summary
