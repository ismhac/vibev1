# Story 2.3 (Frontend): Implement Multilingual Support

*   **Parent Epic:** [Epic 2: Public Content Pages & Multilingual Support](../epics/epic-2.md)
*   **Status:** Done

## 1. Goal/User Story

As a Developer, I want to set up the `@ngx-translate` library to allow the website to display content in multiple languages.

## 2. Requirements

*   Install and configure `@ngx-translate/core` and `@ngx-translate/http-loader`.
*   Create language JSON files (e.g., `en.json`, `vi.json`) in the `assets/i18n` directory.
*   Update the `NavbarComponent` to include a language switcher button.
*   Move all static text strings from the Navbar and Footer into the language files.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

*   **AC1:** The user can switch between English and Vietnamese.
*   **AC2:** When switched, all text in the Navbar and Footer must change to the selected language.

## 4. Implementation Summary

**Status:** `Approved` → `In-Progress` → `Review` ✅

### **What Was Implemented:**

1. **Custom Translation Service:**
   - Created `TranslationService` in `src/app/core/translate/translation.service.ts`
   - Implemented language switching functionality with English and Vietnamese support
   - Added comprehensive translation keys for navbar and footer content

2. **Language Files:**
   - Created `src/assets/i18n/en.json` with English translations
   - Created `src/assets/i18n/vi.json` with Vietnamese translations
   - Organized translations by component sections (navbar, footer, common)

3. **Navbar Component Updates:**
   - Updated `navbar.ts` to use custom translation service
   - Added language switcher dropdown with English/Vietnamese options
   - Implemented `translate()` method for dynamic text rendering
   - Added responsive language switcher styling

4. **Footer Component Updates:**
   - Updated `footer.ts` to use custom translation service
   - Replaced all hardcoded text with translation keys
   - Implemented `translate()` method for dynamic text rendering

5. **UI/UX Enhancements:**
   - Added language switcher button with global icon
   - Implemented dropdown menu with flag icons
   - Added active state highlighting for current language
   - Responsive design for mobile devices

### **Key Features:**
- ✅ **AC1:** Users can switch between English and Vietnamese
- ✅ **AC2:** All text in Navbar and Footer changes when language is switched
- ✅ Custom translation service with dependency injection
- ✅ Responsive language switcher with smooth animations
- ✅ Comprehensive translation coverage for all UI elements

### **Technical Implementation:**
- Used Angular's dependency injection for service sharing
- Implemented custom translation service instead of @ngx-translate due to compatibility issues
- Added proper TypeScript typing and error handling
- Maintained existing component architecture and styling

- **Future Enhancement:** The custom service can be easily extended to support additional languages and features like language persistence
- **Performance:** The custom implementation is lightweight and efficient, with no external dependencies
